# Update Frontmatter

Adds a `file_id` front matter property to files in a given directory and its subdirectories. The front matter is in the form:

```markdown
---
file_id: file_name_20250104_180300_5e9d
---
```

NOTE: I developed the plugin for my own use. It's not heavily tested and is probably best understood to be example code.
