# Update Frontmatter

Adds a `file_id` front matter property to files in a given directory and its subdirectories. The front matter is in the form:

```markdown
---
file_id: file_name_20250104_180300_5e9d
---
```

NOTE: I developed the plugin for my own use. It needs some tests added to it before I'd be comfortable recommending it to others. If you do use it, backup your files first.
